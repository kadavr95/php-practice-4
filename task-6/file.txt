Every time when players gain enough arcane dust they are putted before choice of what card to craft. If there is some splendid card player want the most or if he is aiming to complete some deck, then player already know what he is going to craft next, but otherwise player can be in some kind of deadlock because there are lots of cool cards in game(and not so much of dust). So this rating can help players to better understand power and popularity levels of cards in current meta and to make the right choice.

To create this kind of rating we have gathered data about cards from HSReplay.net, because they have the most actual and largest data set except internal Blizzard data, which is not publicly available.

This rating shows cards ratings in both Standard and Wild formats, as well as overall in game ratings. The ratings are relative to a rating of all cards in case of they power and popularity equality, so rating of 1.00 is an average card, lower ratings are for bad card which are not worthy of crafting and higher ratings are for good cards and the higher rating is the higher is need to craft them. It is also shown the average number of cards copies used in deck to show you if it is needed to craft another copy or one will be enough.
